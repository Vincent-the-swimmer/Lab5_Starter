Make sure you make a PR to your own repo's main and not the class' repo!! Otherwise you will lose points!!

1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

Yes I would use a unit test to test. One use for a unit test could be checking how the program reacts to unsual characters. However I wouldn't just utilize unit tests, but also test multiple components together.

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

Yes you could use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application. There could be invisible characters that aren't be recognized as characters. We want to make sure we understand exactly how the string is being processed and checked before shipping the product.
